The Kendo UI for Angular Icons represent components for displaying font or SVG icons. The Icons are built from the ground up and specifically for Angular, so that you get high-performance icon controls which integrate tightly with your application and with the rest of the Kendo UI for Angular components.

## What's Included in the Angular Icons Package

The [Angular Icons](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/icons) package includes two built-in components:

* [Angular Icon](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/icons/icon)
* [Angular SVGIcon](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/icons/svgicon)

The Icons components allow you customize their appearance. The color and style of the Icons are normally picked up by the current Kendo UI theme, but each aspect of the Icons can be customized by theme variables or configuration options. Kendo UI for Angular delivers a set of popular themes including Bootstrap and Material, all of which can be easily customized with the Progress ThemeBuilder online utility.
