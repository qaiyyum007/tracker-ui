/**
 * Specifies the series type.
 *
 * The supported values are:
 * - `"area"`&mdash;Shows data as continuous lines that display trends over time, evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"bar"`&mdash;Shows data as sets of horizontal bars that display the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"boxPlot"`&mdash;Shows data as a box-and-whisker diagram, which displays the distribution of values in a series.
 * - `"bubble"`&mdash;Shows data as bubbles, where each bubble represents a value from the series data.
 * - `"bullet"`&mdash;Shows data as vertical bars that display the performance measure, and markers that display the comparative measure.
 * - `"candlestick"`&mdash;Shows data as candlesticks, which display the open, close, high, and low values of a series.
 * - `"column"`&mdash;Shows data as sets of vertical bars that display the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"donut"`&mdash;Shows data as a series of rings that are sliced depending on the value.
 * - `"exponentialTrendline"`&mdash;Shows an exponential [trendline]({% slug trendlines_chart_charts %}#toc-exponential-trendline) for the specified parent series.
 * - `"funnel"`&mdash;Shows data as a funnel, which is useful for sales data visualization.
 * - `"heatmap"`&mdash;Shows data as a heatmap, which is useful for comparing values in a matrix.
 * - `"horizontalWaterfall"`&mdash;Shows data as a horizontal waterfall chart, which is useful for comparing positive and negative values over a period.
 * - `"line"`&mdash;Shows data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"linearTrendline"`&mdash;Shows a linear [trendline]({% slug trendlines_chart_charts %}#toc-linear-trendline) for the specified parent series.
 * - `"logarithmicTrendline"`&mdash;Shows a logarithmic [trendline]({% slug trendlines_chart_charts %}#toc-logarithmic-trendline) for the specified parent series.
 * - `"movingAverageTrendline"`&mdash;Shows a moving average [trendline]({% slug trendlines_chart_charts %}#toc-moving-average-trendline) for the specified parent series.
 * - `"ohlc"`&mdash;Shows data as OHLC (open-high-low-close) bars, which display the open, high, low, and close values of a series.
 * - `"pie"`&mdash;Shows data as a series of pie slices, which display the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"polarArea"`&mdash;Shows data as a series of polar area segments, which display the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"polarLine"`&mdash;Shows data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"polarScatter"`&mdash;Shows data as points distributed in a polar coordinate system.
 * - `"polynomialTrendline"`&mdash;Shows a polynomial [trendline]({% slug trendlines_chart_charts %}#toc-polynomial-trendline) for the specified parent series.
 * - `"powerTrendline"`&mdash;Shows a power [trendline]({% slug trendlines_chart_charts %}#toc-power-trendline) for the specified parent series.
 * - `"pyramid"`&mdash;Shows data as a pyramid divided in segments proportional to each value.
 * - `"radarArea"`&mdash;Shows data as a series of radar area segments, which display the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"radarColumn"`&mdash;Shows data as sets of vertical bars that display the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"radarLine"`&mdash;Shows data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"rangeArea"`&mdash;Shows data as a series of range area segments, which display the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"rangeBar"`&mdash;Shows data as sets of horizontal bars that display the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"rangeColumn"`&mdash;Shows data as sets of vertical bars that display the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"scatter"`&mdash;Shows data as points that display the relationship between two variables.
 * - `"scatterLine"`&mdash;Shows data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"verticalArea"`&mdash;Shows data as continuous lines that display trends over time, evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"verticalBoxPlot"`&mdash;Shows data as a box-and-whisker diagram, which displays the distribution of values in a series.
