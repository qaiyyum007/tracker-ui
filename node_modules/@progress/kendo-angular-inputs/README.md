Among the many features which the Kendo UI for Angular Inputs deliver are:

* [Disabled Inputs](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/inputs/maskedtextbox/disabled-state)&mdash;Display the Inputs in their disabled state so that, if need be present, users will not be able to interact with them.

* [Adornments](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/inputs/textbox/adornments)&mdash;You can enhance the visual and functional aspects of the text-based Inputs by using custom adornments in the form of prefixes and suffixes.
* [Labels](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/inputs/checkbox/labels)&mdash;You have the ability to display labels for the Inputs by associating them with a label element. Some of the Inputs also provide built-in properties for customizing their internal labels.
